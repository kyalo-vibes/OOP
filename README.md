# Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals

This project covers the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, following Kunal Kushwaha's YouTube course.

## OOP Concepts Covered

### OOP 1: Classes, Objects, Constructors, and Keywords

* **Classes**: Define blueprints for creating objects
* **Objects**: Instances of classes, representing real-world entities
* **Constructors**: Special methods for initializing objects
* **Keywords**: Understanding the role of keywords like `this`, `new`, and more

### OOP 2: Packages, Static, Singleton Class, In-built Methods

* **Packages**: Grouping related classes and modules together
* **Static**: Methods and variables that belong to the class itself, not to instances
* **Singleton Class**: Ensuring that only one instance of a class is created
* **In-built Methods**: Built-in methods available in Python for working with objects

### OOP 3: Principles - Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction

* **Inheritance**: Creating a new class that is a modified version of an existing class
* **Polymorphism**: Objects of different classes responding to the same message
* **Encapsulation**: Hiding the implementation details of an object from the outside world
* **Abstraction**: Focusing on essential features and hiding non-essential details
