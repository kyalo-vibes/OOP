# Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals

This project covers the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, following Kunal Kushwaha's YouTube course.

## OOP Concepts Covered

### OOP 1: Classes, Objects, Constructors, and Keywords

* **Classes**: Define blueprints for creating objects
* **Objects**: Instances of classes, representing real-world entities
* **Constructors**: Special methods for initializing objects
* **Keywords**: Understanding the role of keywords like `this`, `new`, and more

### OOP 2: Packages, Static, Singleton Class, In-built Methods

* **Packages**: Grouping related classes and modules together
* **Static**: Methods and variables that belong to the class itself, not to instances
* **Singleton Class**: Ensuring that only one instance of a class is created
* **In-built Methods**: Built-in methods available in Python for working with objects

### OOP 3: Principles - Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction

* **Inheritance**: Creating a new class that is a modified version of an existing class
* **Polymorphism**: Objects of different classes responding to the same message
* **Encapsulation**: Hiding the implementation details of an object from the outside world
* **Abstraction**: Focusing on essential features and hiding non-essential details

### OOP 4: Access Control, In-built Packages, Object Class


*   **Access Control**: Restrict access to methods and properties using `public`, `private`, and `protected` modifiers.
*   **In-built Packages**: Pre-defined packages providing classes and methods for specific tasks.
*   **Object Class**: Root class of all classes, providing inherited methods like `toString()`, `equals()`, and `hashCode()`.

### OOP 5 | Abstract Classes, Interfaces, Annotations

*   **Abstract Classes**: Define a blueprint for other classes to follow, providing a way to inherit behavior and state.
*   **Interfaces**: Define a contract that must be implemented by any class that implements it, specifying a set of methods that must be provided.
*   **Annotations**: Add metadata to code, providing additional information about its behavior and purpose, and can be processed at compile-time or runtime.

### OOP 6 | Generics, Custom ArrayList, Lambda Expressions, Exception Handling, Object Cloning

*   **Generics**: Enable type-safe collections and reusable code, allowing for compile-time type checking and preventing runtime type errors.
*   **Custom ArrayList**: Implement a custom ArrayList class, providing a dynamic array-based data structure for storing and manipulating objects.
*   **Lambda Expressions**: Simplify code with concise, anonymous functions, enabling functional programming and improving code readability.
*   **Exception Handling**: Handle runtime errors and exceptions, providing a robust and fault-tolerant way to manage errors and prevent program crashes.
*   **Object Cloning**: Create copies of objects, enabling the creation of independent instances with identical state, and supporting deep copying and defensive copying techniques.

These concepts work together to enable more robust, maintainable, and scalable code, allowing for better organization, reuse, and extension of code.
